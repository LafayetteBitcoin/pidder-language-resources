Public language resource files for pidder
=========================================

For supporting additional languages within pidder, translate these into your native language.

To that end, create a subfolder with the two-letter ISO language code of your target language (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) unless that folder is already available.

Copy the file en/Pidder.po into this folder unless it is already available.

Edit the copied file to translate the msgstr strings while leaving the msgid strings exactly as they are.

A tool specifically designed to edit these files is Poedit (see http://www.poedit.net).
